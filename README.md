## System Requirements for Development:
- Node.js
- npm

## Installation:

2. `cd <project-name>`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`

The project will be running at `http://localhost:3000`

## Developing:

To start developing, run `npm run dev` in the project directory. This will start the development server and open the project in your default browser.

**Hot reloading** is enabled by default. Simply make changes to the files and the browser will auto-refresh.

## Building for Production/Deployment:

To build the project for production, run `npm run build`. This will create a `dist` folder in the project directory with the compiled files.

You can then serve the `dist` folder using a static file server (doesn't matter what language or framework you use, as long as it can serve static files).
